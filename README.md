# MagicDNA 

New software that reduces the amount of time needed to design DNA nanodevices.

## Overview

A team of researchers from the Ohio State Universty has revealed a new piece of software that substantially improves the rate at which nanodevices, specifically those dealing with DNA, can be created. The software stands out against other similar software as it allows users to design intricate nanodevices in just minutes, compared to days in the past, by allowing the entire process to be completed in 3D. MagicDNA also allows users to envision their end result in a real world simulation - this in return eliminates the process of trial and error after the design is completed. Additionally, the software makes it easier for a user to create complex DNA nanodevices while having complete control over the devices' appearances and behaviors through different approaches such as being able to decide the specific arrangement of DNA strands. Hopefully, with the use of software like MagicDNA, improved nanodevices can be created in very short periods of time that will not only focus on helping human biology but other aspects of everyday life.
